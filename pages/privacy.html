    We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
    Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this
    by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.
    Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
    The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
